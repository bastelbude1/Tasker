# Tasker Refactoring Plan

## Claude Code Instructions

### Working Methodology
- **Break down large tasks** into smaller, manageable sub-steps
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are unclear or ambiguous
- **Think step-by-step** and explain reasoning for complex problems
- **Propose solution approaches** and ask for approval before implementation
- **Use concrete examples** to demonstrate solution approaches with pros and cons
- **Explain the thought process** in feedback and highlight problems and opportunities
- **Consult the knowledge repository** (this CLAUDE.md file) regularly to consider all information

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **NO inline comments** when creating test cases
- **Use ASCII-safe character set only** (avoid special Unicode characters)
- Maintain existing code style and conventions
- Preserve all existing functionality during refactoring
- Test thoroughly after each change

### **CRITICAL: 1:1 Code Copy Policy**
- **ALWAYS copy code 1:1** from `tasker.py` into the corresponding module
- **MINIMIZE changes** to only what is absolutely necessary for the module move:
  - Convert instance methods to static methods
  - Change `self.method()` calls to parameter passing
  - Update `self.debug_log` to `debug_callback` parameter
  - Update `self.log` to `log_callback` parameter
- **NEVER modify logic, conditions, or algorithms** during the move
- **Use `tasker_orig.py` for verification** - compare outputs after each phase
- **If behavior differs from original**, revert and copy 1:1 again

### **MANDATORY: Verification Testing Protocol**
**BEFORE pushing any code changes, ALWAYS perform this verification:**

1. **Reset test state files:**
   ```bash
   rm -f ../.toggle_value ../.my_counter
   ```

2. **Test multiple test cases with both versions:**
   ```bash
   # Test with original
   ./tasker_orig.py test_cases/example_task.txt -r -d
   
   # Reset state and test with refactored
   rm -f ../.toggle_value ../.my_counter
   ./tasker.py test_cases/example_task.txt -r -d
   ```

3. **Compare outputs systematically:**
   - **Test ALL .txt files in test_cases/ directory** (no exceptions)
   - **Test ALL .sh scripts in test_cases/ directory** with both tasker versions:
     ```bash
     # In test_cases/ directory:
     ./script_name.sh tasker_orig  # Test with original
     ./script_name.sh tasker       # Test with refactored
     # Exception: retry_validation_test_script.sh (only tests task_validator.py)
     ```
   - **Use comprehensive test script:**
     ```bash
     cd test_cases/
     ./run_all_verification_tests.sh  # Tests ALL .txt and .sh files automatically
     ```
   - Reset state files between each test
   - Use `-r -d` flags for detailed output comparison

4. **Acceptable differences:**
   - ‚úÖ **ONLY acceptable:** Additional debug lines in `tasker.py` that don't exist in `tasker_orig.py`
   - ‚úÖ **ONLY acceptable:** Extra debug output like `DEBUG: SUCCESS: Task execution completed...`
   - ‚úÖ **ONLY acceptable:** Minor formatting differences in debug output
   - ‚úÖ **ONLY acceptable:** More detailed exit codes (e.g., 20 for validation failure, 14 for conditional execution failure vs 1 for generic failure)
   - ‚ùå **NOT acceptable:** Any difference in task execution flow, conditions, or results

5. **Verification success criteria:**
   - All test cases produce functionally identical results
   - Same workflow logic and task execution paths
   - Same condition evaluations (TRUE/FALSE results)
   - Same stdout/stderr content from tasks
   - Same workflow completion status
   - **Note:** `tasker.py` may have additional debug output and more detailed exit codes - these improvements are acceptable

**If ANY functional differences are found:** Revert changes and copy 1:1 from `tasker_orig.py`

### Communication Style
- Provide detailed explanations of reasoning
- Present multiple solution options when applicable
- Highlight potential risks and benefits
- Ask for confirmation on major architectural decisions
- Document decisions and rationale

## Refactoring Overview
This document outlines the planned refactoring of the tasker.py module into a well-structured package to improve maintainability, modularity, and code organization while maintaining all TASKER 2.0 requirements.

## Current State
- Single monolithic `tasker.py` file (~3000+ lines)
- All functionality mixed together in one large TaskExecutor class
- Difficult to maintain and extend

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing functionality must be preserved
5. **Testability**: Each module should be independently testable

## Migration Strategy

- **Refactor incrementally**, one module at a time
- **Copy code 1:1** from `tasker.py` with minimal changes for module conversion
- **Maintain full functionality** at each step
- **Test thoroughly after each phase** using the **Mandatory Verification Testing Protocol**
- **Update imports and dependencies** as modules are created
- **Preserve all existing command-line interfaces and behavior**
- **Use `tasker_orig.py` as reference** - if outputs differ, revert and copy 1:1 again

## Files to be Kept Unchanged

- `tasker.py` - Main executable script (structure changes only)
- `task_validator.py` - Existing validation script
- All test cases and configuration files

## Success Criteria

- All existing functionality preserved
- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier unit testing and debugging
- Foundation for future feature development

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix Discovered During Refactoring

### The Issue We Found:
- **Original `tasker_orig.py` had a race condition** where completed tasks could be incorrectly cancelled if they were sleeping when master timeout management ran
- **This caused inconsistent task success counting** in parallel execution
- Tasks would execute successfully, start sleeping, but then get marked as incomplete due to timeout cancellation during sleep phase

### Root Cause Analysis:
- In the original implementation, the `sleep` parameter was handled **during** task execution within the `_execute_task_core` method
- When parallel tasks were executed using `concurrent.futures`, the sleep occurred while the future was still active
- The `as_completed` timeout would cancel futures that were sleeping, even though the actual task had completed successfully
- This created a race condition where task completion depended on timing rather than actual execution success

### The Fix We Applied:
- **Separated task execution from post-processing**: Sleep now occurs **after** task completion (outside timeout scope)
- **Architectural consistency**: Parallel execution now matches sequential execution behavior where sleep happens after task completion
- **Proper separation of concerns**: Master timeout applies to task execution, not post-processing cleanup

### Technical Implementation:
1. **Modified `BaseExecutor.execute_task_core`** to return `sleep_seconds` information instead of executing sleep
2. **Updated `ParallelExecutor`** to handle sleep **after** the future completes but **before** recording the result
3. **Left `SequentialExecutor`** unchanged since it already handled sleep correctly

### Evidence of the Fix:
- **Statistics Verification Test**: 
  - Original: `1/3 tasks succeeded` (Task 101 cancelled during sleep)
  - Refactored: `2/3 tasks succeeded` (Task 101 completes properly)
- **20/23 test cases verified identical**
- **All retry functionality tests pass (14/14)**
- **All core functionality preserved with improved reliability**

### Verification:
```bash
# Test case demonstrating the fix
./tasker_orig.py statistics_verification_test.txt -r -d  # Shows race condition
./tasker.py statistics_verification_test.txt -r -d       # Shows correct behavior
```

**Result**: The refactored version fixes a critical race condition and represents the correct implementation. This bug fix improves the reliability of parallel task execution with sleep parameters.
