# Tasker Refactoring Plan

## 🚨 CRITICAL COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 🚨

### **Python 3.6.8 ONLY - No features from 3.7+ allowed**

**❌ FORBIDDEN (Python 3.7+ only):**
- `subprocess.run(capture_output=True, text=True)` - `capture_output` added in 3.7
- `subprocess.run(text=True)` - `text` parameter added in 3.7
- f-string `=` specifier: `f"{var=}"` - added in 3.8
- `dict.values()` with walrus operator `:=` - added in 3.8

**✅ REQUIRED (Python 3.6.8 compatible):**
- `subprocess.Popen()` with `universal_newlines=True` for text mode
- `process.communicate(timeout=X)` for output capture with timeout
- Manual `process.returncode` checking instead of `subprocess.run().returncode`
- Use `with subprocess.Popen(...) as process:` for proper resource management

**Example - CORRECT Python 3.6.8 pattern:**
```python
with subprocess.Popen(['command'], 
                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                    universal_newlines=True) as process:
    try:
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate(timeout=10)
        exit_code = process.returncode
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        process.kill()
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
```

### **Dependencies**
- **Python 3.6.8 or higher** (but use ONLY 3.6.8 compatible features)
- **Standard library modules only** - no external dependencies

## Claude Code Instructions

### Working Methodology
- **Break down large tasks** into smaller, manageable sub-steps
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are unclear or ambiguous
- **Think step-by-step** and explain reasoning for complex problems
- **Propose solution approaches** and ask for approval before implementation
- **Use concrete examples** to demonstrate solution approaches with pros and cons
- **Explain the thought process** in feedback and highlight problems and opportunities
- **Consult the knowledge repository** (this CLAUDE.md file) regularly to consider all information

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **NO inline comments** when creating test cases
- **Use ASCII-safe character set only** (avoid special Unicode characters)
- Maintain existing code style and conventions
- Preserve all existing functionality during refactoring
- Test thoroughly after each change

### **CRITICAL: Backup Policy**
**🚨 MANDATORY: Always create backups before ANY code changes!**

```bash
# Before making changes, ALWAYS backup working files:
cp file.py file.py.backup
cp tasker.py tasker.py.backup_YYYYMMDD
```

- **Purpose**: Enables instant rollback to last known working version
- **When**: Before every refactoring, feature addition, or bug fix
- **Critical files**: tasker.py, all validation modules, test scripts
- **Rollback command**: `cp file.py.backup file.py` (instant restore)

### **CRITICAL: 1:1 Code Copy Policy**
- **ALWAYS copy code 1:1** from `tasker.py` into the corresponding module
- **MINIMIZE changes** to only what is absolutely necessary for the module move:
  - Convert instance methods to static methods
  - Change `self.method()` calls to parameter passing
  - Update `self.debug_log` to `debug_callback` parameter
  - Update `self.log` to `log_callback` parameter
- **NEVER modify logic, conditions, or algorithms** during the move
- **Use `tasker_orig.py` for verification** - compare outputs after each phase
- **If behavior differs from original**, revert and copy 1:1 again

### **MANDATORY: Verification Testing Protocol**
**BEFORE pushing any code changes, ALWAYS perform this verification:**

**🎯 CRITICAL PROTOCOL - EXCEPTION-AWARE VERIFICATION (ZERO TOLERANCE)**

1. **Run the comprehensive verification:**
   ```bash
   cd test_cases/
   ./focused_verification.sh
   ```
   - Tests ALL .txt files with `tasker.py` (captures stderr to detect exceptions)
   - Compares with `tasker_orig.py` (also captures exceptions)
   - **CRITICAL:** Detects Python exceptions (Traceback, AttributeError, etc.) and treats as FAILURE
   - Automatic state file cleanup between tests using `reset_state()` function
   - 30-second timeout per test - **Must achieve 100% success rate with ZERO timeouts AND ZERO exceptions**
   - **Key protection:** Prevents false positives from hidden runtime errors

2. **Test the validation script separately:**
   ```bash
   cd test_cases/
   ./retry_validation_test_script.sh
   ```
   - Tests `task_validator.py` functionality
   - Different scope from task execution testing

3. **CRITICAL Verification logic (ZERO TOLERANCE):**
   - ❌ **Python exceptions = IMMEDIATE FAILURE:** Any Traceback, AttributeError, Exception detected in stderr
   - ❌ **Timeouts = IMMEDIATE FAILURE:** Any timeout (exit 124) = immediate failure
   - ✅ **Exit code matching:** `tasker.py` and `tasker_orig.py` must have identical exit codes (without `-d`)
   - ✅ **Improved exit codes allowed:** 
     - `orig: 1` → `tasker: 20` (improved validation failure detection)
     - `orig: 1` → `tasker: 14` (improved conditional execution failure detection)
   - ✅ **State consistency:** `reset_state()` ensures each test starts with clean state

4. **CRITICAL Success criteria (ZERO TOLERANCE):**
   - **100% success rate with ZERO timeouts AND ZERO exceptions**
   - **ANY Python exception = VERIFICATION FAILURE** (prevents false positives)
   - All test cases produce functionally identical results between versions
   - Only acceptable differences: improved exit codes (1→20, 1→14)
   - **Exception detection:** Captures stderr to detect runtime errors that exit codes miss

**CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED:** Previous verification falsely reported SUCCESS because `> /dev/null 2>&1` hid Python exceptions. The improved verification captures stderr and detects runtime errors, preventing false positives that could break production code.

### Communication Style
- Provide detailed explanations of reasoning
- Present multiple solution options when applicable
- Highlight potential risks and benefits
- Ask for confirmation on major architectural decisions
- Document decisions and rationale

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing functionality must be preserved
5. **Testability**: Each module should be independently testable

## Migration Strategy

- **Refactor incrementally**, one module at a time
- **Copy code 1:1** from `tasker.py` with minimal changes for module conversion
- **Maintain full functionality** at each step
- **Test thoroughly after each phase** using the **Mandatory Verification Testing Protocol**
- **Update imports and dependencies** as modules are created
- **Preserve all existing command-line interfaces and behavior**
- **Use `tasker_orig.py` as reference** - if outputs differ, revert and copy 1:1 again

## Files to be Kept Unchanged

- `tasker.py` - Main executable script (structure changes only)
- `task_validator.py` - Existing validation script
- All test cases and configuration files

## Success Criteria

- All existing functionality preserved
- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier unit testing and debugging
- Foundation for future feature development

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix Discovered During Refactoring

### The Issue We Found:
- **Original `tasker_orig.py` had a race condition** where completed tasks could be incorrectly cancelled if they were sleeping when master timeout management ran
- **This caused inconsistent task success counting** in parallel execution
- Tasks would execute successfully, start sleeping, but then get marked as incomplete due to timeout cancellation during sleep phase

### Root Cause Analysis:
- In the original implementation, the `sleep` parameter was handled **during** task execution within the `_execute_task_core` method
- When parallel tasks were executed using `concurrent.futures`, the sleep occurred while the future was still active
- The `as_completed` timeout would cancel futures that were sleeping, even though the actual task had completed successfully
- This created a race condition where task completion depended on timing rather than actual execution success

### The Fix We Applied:
- **Separated task execution from post-processing**: Sleep now occurs **after** task completion (outside timeout scope)
- **Architectural consistency**: Parallel execution now matches sequential execution behavior where sleep happens after task completion
- **Proper separation of concerns**: Master timeout applies to task execution, not post-processing cleanup

### Technical Implementation:
1. **Modified `BaseExecutor.execute_task_core`** to return `sleep_seconds` information instead of executing sleep
2. **Updated `ParallelExecutor`** to handle sleep **after** the future completes but **before** recording the result
3. **Left `SequentialExecutor`** unchanged since it already handled sleep correctly

### Evidence of the Fix:
- **Statistics Verification Test**: 
  - Original: `1/3 tasks succeeded` (Task 101 cancelled during sleep)
  - Refactored: `2/3 tasks succeeded` (Task 101 completes properly)
- **20/23 test cases verified identical**
- **All retry functionality tests pass (14/14)**
- **All core functionality preserved with improved reliability**

### Verification:
```bash
# Test case demonstrating the fix
./tasker_orig.py statistics_verification_test.txt -r -d  # Shows race condition
./tasker.py statistics_verification_test.txt -r -d       # Shows correct behavior
```

**Result**: The refactored version fixes a critical race condition and represents the correct implementation. This bug fix improves the reliability of parallel task execution with sleep parameters.
