# TASKER Architecture Review Report
**Generated**: Thu Oct  2 00:22:47 CEST 2025
**Review Type**: Architecture Analysis using Claude Code /review
**Focus Areas**: Modular design, coupling, interfaces, extensibility

## Files Reviewed
- ✅ tasker/core/task_executor_main.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/base_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/sequential_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/parallel_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/validation/task_validator.py
- ✅ tasker/core/condition_evaluator.py
- ❌ tasker/utils/format_utils.py (not found)
- ✅ tasker.py

## Architecture Context Applied
- Modular architecture with Executor pattern
- Callback-based logging and debugging
- Clear separation of concerns (validation, execution, evaluation)
- Interface consistency and extensibility focus
- Minimal coupling between components

## Review Command Template
```bash
# Manual execution in Claude Code:
/review

# With architecture focus on:
# - Module separation and responsibilities
# - Interface design and consistency
# - Coupling and cohesion analysis
# - Extensibility and maintainability
# - Design pattern implementation
```

## Architecture Analysis Areas
### 1. Module Separation
- [x] Clear boundaries between core, executors, validation, and utils
- [x] Single responsibility principle adherence
- [x] Appropriate abstraction levels

### 2. Interface Design
- [x] Consistent callback interface (log_callback, debug_callback)
- [x] Clean executor base class design
- [x] Validation interface clarity
- [x] Condition evaluation interface

### 3. Coupling Analysis
- [ ] Low coupling between modules - **ISSUE: Circular imports detected**
- [x] Dependency direction correctness
- [ ] Circular dependency avoidance - **ISSUE: Found between tasker.py and task_executor_main.py**
- [x] Appropriate use of dependency injection

### 4. Extensibility
- [x] Easy addition of new executors
- [ ] Plugin-style architecture for new features
- [x] Configuration-driven behavior
- [x] Backward compatibility considerations

### 5. Design Patterns
- [x] Executor pattern implementation quality
- [x] Callback pattern effectiveness
- [ ] Factory pattern usage (if applicable)
- [x] Strategy pattern for different execution types

## Instructions for Manual Review
1. Open Claude Code in the TASKER project directory
2. Use the /review command
3. Focus on architectural aspects of the files listed above
4. Apply the architecture context from: /home/baste/tasker/code_review/scripts/../reports/architecture_context.md
5. Evaluate design patterns, coupling, and extensibility

## Review Findings (Completed)

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Circular Import Dependencies**
   - Location: `tasker.py:47` and `task_executor_main.py:7`
   - Impact: Tight coupling, difficult testing, maintenance issues
   - Recommendation: Extract shared functionality to separate utility module

2. **God Class Anti-Pattern**
   - Location: `task_executor_main.py:21` (TaskExecutorMain class)
   - Impact: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, hard to maintain
   - Recommendation: Split into smaller, focused classes (TaskRunner, StateManager, etc.)

3. **Thread Safety Concerns**
   - Location: `parallel_executor.py:129-140`
   - Impact: Potential race conditions with concurrent state modifications
   - Recommendation: Add proper locking mechanisms or use thread-safe data structures

### Architecture Strengths
- Clear executor pattern implementation with good abstraction
- Consistent callback interface throughout the codebase
- Good separation between validation and execution logic
- Extensible design for adding new executor types

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Resolve circular imports by extracting shared code
2. **Short-term**: Refactor TaskExecutorMain to follow SRP
3. **Medium-term**: Implement thread-safe state management
4. **Long-term**: Consider plugin architecture for executor loading
