## Architecture Context Applied
- Modular architecture with Executor pattern
- Callback-based logging and debugging
- Clear separation of concerns (validation, execution, evaluation)
- Interface consistency and extensibility focus
- Minimal coupling between components

## Review Command Template
```bash
# Manual execution in Claude Code:
/review

# With architecture focus on:
# - Module separation and responsibilities
# - Interface design and consistency
# - Coupling and cohesion analysis
# - Extensibility and maintainability
# - Design pattern implementation
```

## Architecture Analysis Areas
### 1. Module Separation
- [ ] Clear boundaries between core, executors, validation, and utils
- [ ] Single responsibility principle adherence
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels

### 2. Interface Design
- [ ] Consistent callback interface (log_callback, debug_callback)
- [ ] Clean executor base class design
- [ ] Validation interface clarity
- [ ] Condition evaluation interface

### 3. Coupling Analysis
- [ ] Low coupling between modules
- [ ] Dependency direction correctness
- [ ] Circular dependency avoidance
- [ ] Appropriate use of dependency injection

### 4. Extensibility
- [ ] Easy addition of new executors
- [ ] Plugin-style architecture for new features
- [ ] Configuration-driven behavior
- [ ] Backward compatibility considerations

### 5. Design Patterns
- [ ] Executor pattern implementation quality
- [ ] Callback pattern effectiveness
- [ ] Factory pattern usage (if applicable)
- [ ] Strategy pattern for different execution types

## Instructions for Manual Review
1. Open Claude Code in the TASKER project directory
2. Use the /review command
3. Focus on architectural aspects of the files listed above
4. Apply the architecture context from: /home/baste/tasker/code_review/scripts/../reports/architecture_context.md
5. Evaluate design patterns, coupling, and extensibility

## Expected Findings Areas
- [ ] Module boundary violations
- [ ] Interface inconsistencies
- [ ] Tight coupling issues
- [ ] Extensibility limitations
- [ ] Design pattern misuse
- [ ] Abstraction level problems
