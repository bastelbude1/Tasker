# TASKER Performance Review Context

## Performance-Critical Areas
TASKER processes multiple tasks with parallel execution, timeout management, and remote command execution.

## Key Performance Aspects
1. **Parallel Execution**: ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent task processing
2. **Timeout Management**: Master timeout with task cancellation
3. **Resource Management**: Memory usage with large task workflows
4. **I/O Efficiency**: Remote command execution and output processing
5. **Threading Safety**: Concurrent access to shared state

## Performance Bottlenecks to Analyze
1. **Thread Pool Management**: Optimal thread count, task scheduling
2. **Memory Usage**: Large stdout/stderr handling, variable storage
3. **Timeout Precision**: Cancellation efficiency, resource cleanup
4. **Network I/O**: SSH connection pooling, command execution overhead
5. **Condition Evaluation**: Regex performance in output processing

## Current Implementation Details
- **Python 3.6.8**: Limited to older concurrent.futures implementation
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Used for parallel task execution
- **subprocess.Popen**: All command execution (no async/await available)
- **No external libraries**: Standard library performance patterns only
- **Memory constraints**: Must handle large output efficiently

## Performance Requirements
- Support 100+ parallel tasks efficiently
- Handle multi-MB stdout/stderr without memory issues
- Quick timeout response (sub-second cancellation)
- Minimal resource leakage between task executions
- Scalable to enterprise workload sizes

## Critical Performance Files
- parallel_executor.py: Core parallel execution logic
- timeout_manager.py: Timeout and cancellation handling
- condition_evaluator.py: Output processing and regex evaluation
- format_utils.py: Output formatting efficiency
