## Performance Context Applied
- Python 3.6.8 parallel execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Timeout management and task cancellation
- Memory efficiency for large stdout/stderr handling
- I/O optimization for remote command execution
- Threading safety and resource cleanup

## Review Command Template
```bash
# Manual execution in Claude Code:
/review

# With performance focus on:
# - Parallel execution efficiency
# - Memory usage optimization
# - Threading and concurrency safety
# - I/O and network efficiency
# - Resource management and cleanup
```

## Performance Analysis Areas
### 1. Parallel Execution Efficiency
- [ ] ThreadPoolExecutor configuration and sizing
- [ ] Task scheduling and load balancing
- [ ] Future object management and cleanup
- [ ] Exception handling in concurrent context
- [ ] Thread pool shutdown procedures

### 2. Memory Management
- [ ] Large stdout/stderr handling strategies
- [ ] Variable storage and cleanup
- [ ] Memory leaks in long-running workflows
- [ ] Garbage collection considerations
- [ ] Buffer size optimization

### 3. Timeout and Cancellation
- [ ] Master timeout implementation efficiency
- [ ] Task cancellation speed and reliability
- [ ] Resource cleanup after cancellation
- [ ] Timeout precision and overhead
- [ ] Deadlock prevention in cancellation

### 4. I/O and Network Performance
- [ ] subprocess.Popen efficiency patterns
- [ ] Output streaming vs buffering strategies
- [ ] Network connection reuse opportunities
- [ ] Command execution batching potential
- [ ] Error handling performance impact

### 5. Algorithm Efficiency
- [ ] Condition evaluation regex performance
- [ ] Variable replacement algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Loop optimization in task processing
- [ ] Data structure choices (lists vs dicts)
- [ ] String processing optimization

### 6. Resource Management
- [ ] File handle management and cleanup
- [ ] Process lifecycle management
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup
- [ ] Memory usage profiling needs
- [ ] CPU usage optimization

## Python 3.6.8 Performance Constraints
- [ ] Limited concurrent.futures features
- [ ] No async/await syntax available
- [ ] Standard library threading only
- [ ] No modern performance libraries
- [ ] Subprocess limitations vs newer APIs

## Instructions for Manual Review
1. Open Claude Code in the TASKER project directory
2. Use the /review command
3. Focus on performance aspects of the files listed above
4. Apply the performance context from: /home/baste/tasker/code_review/scripts/../reports/performance_context.md
5. Look for optimization opportunities and bottlenecks

## Expected Findings Areas
- [ ] Thread pool size optimization
- [ ] Memory usage improvements
- [ ] I/O efficiency enhancements
- [ ] Algorithm optimization opportunities
- [ ] Resource cleanup improvements
- [ ] Concurrency safety issues
