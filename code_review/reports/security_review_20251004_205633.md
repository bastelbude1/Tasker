**Generated**: Sat Oct  4 20:56:33 CEST 2025
**Review Type**: Security Analysis using Claude Code /security-review
**Focus Areas**: Command injection, input validation, file handling, subprocess security

## Files Reviewed
- ✅ tasker.py
- ✅ tasker/core/task_executor_main.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/base_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/sequential_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/executors/parallel_executor.py
- ✅ tasker/validation/task_validator.py
- ✅ tasker/core/condition_evaluator.py

## Security Context Applied
- Python 3.6.8 task automation system
- Remote command execution via subprocess.Popen()
- User-controlled input from task files
- No external security libraries available
- Standard library security patterns only

## Review Command Template
```bash
# Manual execution in Claude Code:
/security-review

# With context focus on:
# - Command injection in subprocess calls
# - Input validation vulnerabilities
# - File handling security issues
# - Privilege escalation prevention
# - Path traversal protection
```

## Instructions for Manual Review
1. Open Claude Code in the TASKER project directory
2. Use the /security-review command
3. Focus on the files listed above
4. Apply the security context from: /home/baste/tasker/code_review/scripts/../reports/security_context.md
5. Look for the specific vulnerability patterns mentioned

## Expected Findings Areas
- [ ] Subprocess command construction safety
- [ ] Input sanitization completeness
- [ ] File path validation
- [ ] Error message information leakage
- [ ] Authentication/authorization bypass
- [ ] Logging security (sensitive data exposure)
