## Test Statistics
- **Total Test Cases**: 34 functional tests
- **Mock Commands**: 3 test doubles
- **Verification Scripts**: 12 automation scripts
- **Success Rate Requirement**: 100% (ZERO TOLERANCE)

## Test Coverage Context Applied
- 41 test cases with comprehensive scenario coverage
- 100% success rate requirement enforcement
- Mock command infrastructure for external dependencies
- Robust verification protocol with exception detection
- Complete state isolation between test executions

## Review Command Template
```bash
# Manual execution in Claude Code:
/review

# With test coverage focus on:
# - Test case completeness and coverage gaps
# - Edge case and error scenario testing
# - Test quality and maintainability
# - Mock infrastructure adequacy
# - Verification protocol robustness
```

## Test Coverage Analysis Areas
### 1. Functional Coverage
- [ ] All core features have corresponding test cases
- [ ] Sequential task execution testing
- [ ] Parallel task execution with various configurations
- [ ] Conditional logic and flow control scenarios
- [ ] Variable resolution and global variable usage
- [ ] Retry mechanisms and failure recovery

### 2. Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] Timeout scenarios and cancellation testing
- [ ] Resource exhaustion and memory limits
- [ ] Invalid input and malformed task files
- [ ] Network failures and connectivity issues
- [ ] Boundary conditions (max tasks, large outputs)
- [ ] Race conditions in parallel execution

### 3. Error Scenario Testing
- [ ] Exception handling and error propagation
- [ ] Failed command execution scenarios
- [ ] Validation failures and error messages
- [ ] Recovery from partial failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation testing

### 4. Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end workflow scenarios
- [ ] Multi-task dependency chains
- [ ] Complex parallel execution patterns
- [ ] Real-world automation use cases
- [ ] Cross-module interaction testing

### 5. Test Infrastructure Quality
- [ ] Mock command completeness and accuracy
- [ ] State isolation between tests
- [ ] Test execution reliability (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Exception detection robustness
- [ ] Timeout management effectiveness

### 6. New Feature Testing
- [ ] Delimiter enhancement testing (newline, colon, semicolon)
- [ ] Recent architecture changes coverage
- [ ] Regression prevention for fixed bugs
- [ ] Backward compatibility verification

### 7. Test Maintainability
- [ ] Clear test case documentation
- [ ] Easy addition of new test cases
- [ ] Debugging support for test failures
- [ ] Test execution performance
- [ ] Test result reporting clarity

## Critical Coverage Gaps to Identify
- [ ] Missing test cases for core functionality
- [ ] Insufficient edge case coverage
- [ ] Inadequate error scenario testing
- [ ] Missing integration test scenarios
- [ ] Incomplete mock coverage
- [ ] Insufficient regression testing

## Test Quality Assessment
- [ ] Test case clarity and documentation
- [ ] Appropriate test data and scenarios
- [ ] Mock realism and completeness
- [ ] Test execution reliability
- [ ] Result verification accuracy
- [ ] Maintenance burden evaluation

## Instructions for Manual Review
1. Open Claude Code in the TASKER project directory
2. Use the /review command
3. Focus on test coverage aspects of the files listed above
4. Apply the test coverage context from: /home/baste/tasker/code_review/scripts/../reports/test_coverage_context.md
5. Evaluate completeness, quality, and maintainability

## Expected Findings Areas
- [ ] Test coverage gaps for specific features
- [ ] Missing edge case scenarios
- [ ] Inadequate error condition testing
- [ ] Test infrastructure improvements needed
- [ ] Test maintainability issues
- [ ] Verification protocol enhancements
