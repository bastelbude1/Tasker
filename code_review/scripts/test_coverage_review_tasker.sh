# TASKER Test Coverage Review Context

## Test Suite Overview
TASKER has 86 test cases with a 100% success rate requirement (ZERO TOLERANCE policy).

## Test Architecture
1. **Test Cases**: 86 .txt files organized in categories (functional/, integration/, edge_cases/, security/)
2. **Verification Protocol**: test_cases/scripts/focused_verification.sh for automated testing
3. **Mock Commands**: Test doubles for pbrun, p7s, wwrs commands
4. **State Management**: Clean state between tests
5. **Exception Detection**: Robust error detection in test execution

## Test Categories
### Functional Tests
- Basic task execution (sequential, parallel)
- Conditional logic and flow control
- Retry mechanisms and failure handling
- Timeout management and cancellation
- Variable resolution and global variables
- Host validation and connectivity

### Integration Tests
- Complete workflow scenarios
- Multi-task dependencies
- Complex parallel execution patterns
- Real-world automation workflows

### Edge Case Tests
- Timeout scenarios and cancellation
- Failure recovery and retry logic
- Invalid input handling
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Error condition testing

### Validation Tests
- Parameter validation testing
- Input sanitization verification
- Error message validation
- Configuration validation

## Test Quality Requirements
- **100% Success Rate**: All tests must pass (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **Complete Coverage**: All features must have test cases
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Error scenarios and boundary conditions
- **State Isolation**: Tests must not interfere with each other
- **Mock Completeness**: All external dependencies mocked
- **Error Detection**: Robust exception and failure detection

## Test Infrastructure
- **Mock Commands**: test_cases/bin/ directory with pbrun, p7s, wwrs_clir
- **Verification Script**: test_cases/scripts/focused_verification.sh for orchestration
- **State Reset**: Cleanup between tests to prevent interference
- **Timeout Management**: 60-second timeout per test
- **Exception Detection**: stderr monitoring for Python exceptions

## Critical Test Areas
1. **Delimiter Functionality**: New delimiter keywords (newline, colon, semicolon)
2. **Parallel Execution**: ThreadPoolExecutor with timeout management
3. **Retry Logic**: Complex retry scenarios with various conditions
4. **Condition Evaluation**: Success/failure condition processing
5. **Variable Resolution**: Global and task variable handling
6. **Error Handling**: Exception propagation and recovery
