# Simple timeout comparison test
#
# **KNOWN TIMING DEPENDENCY:**
# This test generates 2-3 warnings depending on system load and timing:
#   1. "Timeout 3 too low, using minimum 5" for task 100 (always)
#   2. "Timeout 3 too low, using minimum 5" for task 101 (always)
#   3. Third warning timing-dependent (appears under normal load, missing under heavy load)
#
# The test validates parallel execution with min_success routing where one task
# completes quickly and the other sleeps after completion.
# Warning count variation is acceptable for this test.
