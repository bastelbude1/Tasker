# Test that --force-instance flag works and allows execution
# This is a basic acceptance test that verifies the flag is recognized
# VERIFIED: Manual testing confirms "WARNING: Instance check bypassed" is emitted
# NOTE: Full contention testing (with pre-existing lock) would require
# multi-process test infrastructure not available in this harness
