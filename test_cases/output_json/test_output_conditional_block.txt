# Test JSON output generation for conditional block workflow
# Expected: Task 0 runs, decision block (Task 1) evaluates @0_exit@=0 as true, routes to Task 2, then Task 4

# Task 0: Check condition (regular task)

command=true
exec=local

# Task 1: Decision block - route based on task 0 result
task=1
type=decision

on_failure=3

# Task 2: Executed if condition is true
task=2
hostname=localhost
command=echo
arguments=Condition was true
exec=local
on_success=4

# Task 3: Should NOT execute (condition was true)
task=3
hostname=localhost
command=echo
arguments=Condition was false

# Task 4: Final task
